# VoidWatch 🛰️
### Space Debris Collision Prediction System

An agentic AI system that predicts collision risk between orbital objects using 
real ESA Conjunction Data Messages. Built with a Random Forest Classifier trained 
on 162,634 real conjunction events.

## Dataset

This project uses the ESA Collision Avoidance Challenge dataset from Kaggle.

Download here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shadmanrohan/collisionavoidancechallenge

Place both files in `data/raw/` before running the notebooks.

---

## Download Trained Model

The trained model is 128MB and hosted on Google Drive.

**Download:** [voidwatch_model.pkl](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xQcHpxMFGhou6qXqsDzvdm4Csdg0rXL9/view?usp=drive_link)

Place the downloaded file in the `model/` folder before running the API.

## How It Works

**Three layer pipeline:**

**1. Data Ingestion**
Raw Conjunction Data Messages from ESA containing orbital parameters
for two objects on a collision course — the target satellite and
the chaser object (debris or another satellite).

**2. Prediction Engine**
Random Forest Classifier trained on 38 orbital features including
miss distance, relative velocity, position uncertainty (sigma values),
and Mahalanobis distance. Outputs three risk classes:

- 🔴 HIGH — collision probability > 10^-5
- 🟡 MEDIUM — collision probability between 10^-10 and 10^-5
- 🟢 LOW — collision probability < 10^-10

**3. API Layer**
FastAPI endpoint that accepts conjunction features and returns
structured JSON with risk level, probabilities, top risk factors,
and maneuver recommendation.

## Key Features

- Trained on 162,634 real ESA conjunction events
- Handles class imbalance with balanced class weighting
- Explainable output, top risk factors per prediction
- Actionable recommendations, maneuver window and urgency level
- REST API ready for frontend integration

## Local Setup

**1. Clone the repo**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SharmaOmm/VoidWatch.git
cd VoidWatch
```

**2. Download the trained model**
Download `voidwatch_model.pkl` from the link above and place it in the `model/` folder.

**3. Install dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r api/requirements.txt
```

**4. Run the API**
```bash
cd api
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

**5. Test with sample input**

A `sample_input.json` is included in the `api/` folder with a real 
conjunction event. Use it directly to test the endpoint.
```bash
cd api
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/predict \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d @sample_input.json
```

Or once the API is running, open http://localhost:8000/docs 
in your browser for the interactive testing interface.
